    "Typically, data isn't readily formatted for direct input into machine learning models. It's crucial for a machine learning practitioner to examine each column and determine an effective method for encoding its information. Let's determine the types of features we have and come up with suitable encoding strategies for them. "

    "2) It is important because a violation introduces data leakage and the model's permormance is overestimated. The model will likely generalize worse to unseen data, which is a worse classifier, since that is its purpose.\n",
    "3) It simplifies the workflow when combining preprocessing and model, making the code more readable. It also prevents data leakage in the way that it handles transformations (such as scaling)\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for the hyperparameter `C` of SVC RBF classifier. In practice, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for all different hyperparameters of the most promising classifiers. For the purpose of this assignment, we'll only do it for the `SVC` classifier with one hyperparameter, namely `C`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each `C` value in the `param_grid` below: \n",
    "    - Create a pipeline object with two steps: preprocessor from 4.4 and `SVC` classifier with the `C` value.\n",
    "    - Carry out 5-fold cross validation with the pipeline.  \n",
    "    - Store the results in `results_dict` and display results as a pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "2. Which hyperparameter value seems to be performing the best? In this assignment, consider the hyperparameter value that gives you the highest cross-validation score as the \"best\" one. Store it in a variable called `best_C`. (Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.) Is it different than the default value for the hyperparameter used by `scikit-learn`? \n",
